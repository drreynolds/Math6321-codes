    Usage: coeffs, errorterm = fd_maker(stencil, deriv)

    Utility to compute classical finite difference approximation to a requested derivative
    using a specified set of nodes.  We assume that all nodes are evenly spaced, with a
    spacing of 'h', and that the derivative is requested at the node "0", meaning that the
    location of each node may be uniquely specified by a "stencil" of offsets from the
    derivative location.

    Inputs:  stencil = array of integer offsets from node "0" that
                        will be used in approximation, e.g. [-1, 0, 1]
                        for f(x-h), f(x) and f(x+h)
             deriv = integer specifying the desired derivative

    Outputs: coeffs = row vector of finite-difference coefficients s.t.
                         f^(deriv) \approx \sum coeffs(i)*f(x+stencil(i)*h)
             errorterm = leading error term in derivative approximation
